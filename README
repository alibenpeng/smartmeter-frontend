Abstract
--------

This is a Smartmeter frontend in javascript. It uses a
rrd (round robin db) file as backend.
For details about round robin databases see
http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/

This project uses code from various sources, mainly
javascriptrrd to access the rrd-file and flotr2 to draw
the graphs.

Getting started
---------------

1. Create the rrd file like this:

$ rrdtool create smartmeter.rrd --start 1337212800 --step 60 \
	DS:counter1:ABSOLUTE:120:0:100000 \
	DS:counter2:ABSOLUTE:120:0:100000 \
	DS:counter3:ABSOLUTE:120:0:100000 \
	DS:lost:ABSOLUTE:120:0:100000 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2880 \
	RRA:MIN:0.5:1:2880 \
	RRA:MAX:0.5:1:2880 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5:4320 \
	RRA:MIN:0.5:5:4320 \
	RRA:MAX:0.5:5:4320 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:60:4320 \
	RRA:MIN:0.5:60:4320 \
	RRA:MAX:0.5:60:4320 \
	RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:360:3650 \
	RRA:MIN:0.5:360:3650 \
	RRA:MAX:0.5:360:3650

2. put some data into the rrd file like this:

$ rrdtool update smartmeter.rrd N:1:2:3:4


Hardware
--------

To have this software do anything usefull you need some
hardware to fill the rrd-file. 

Right now the code is built around three counters that
generate 2000 impulses per consumed kWh. These counters
are very common in europe and fairly cheap. The hardware
used in this project is described in more detail here:
